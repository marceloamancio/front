# Primitive types

* Number, string, boolean
* Null, Undefined
* Sumbol, BigInt
* NaN 0/0 -> NaN; 1 + Nan = NaN 
* Infinity; -Infinity

# In Chrome:
* View > Developers > Javascript console. (Cmd + Alt + J in mac).
* numbers have not much precision.
* clear() -> Ctrl + l to clean (mac).

# Variables
* let someName = value;
* same names can not be used as variable names e.g 'let', 'document'
* Usually in javascript do it using camelCase.
* we can not redeclare a variable
* const someName = value; // which never changes
* var tripDistance = 3.4 // var used to be the only way to declare a variable in javascript; nowadays we shouldn't use it anymore. 
* let myVariable = true; // or false - we are declaring a boolean here.
* let name = "my name"; // or 'my name' --> single or double quotes will do that;
* typeof -> get the type of an variable
* concatenate string: "a" + "b" = "ab"
* "hi" + 1 = "hi1"
